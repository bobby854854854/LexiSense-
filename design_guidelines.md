## Images

**Hero Image:** No large hero image needed - this is a utility application focused on dashboard functionality. The login/marketing pages (if separate) can have abstract geometric patterns or subtle contract/document imagery in the background with low opacity.

**Icon Usage:** Heroicons (outline style for navigation, solid for indicators)

**In-App Imagery:**
- Empty states: Simple illustrations (not photos) showing the feature value
- Profile avatars: Circle crop, initials fallback
- Document thumbnails: PDF-style previews
- AI feature badges: Sparkle/star icon indicators

This professional, data-centric design will convey enterprise credibility while maintaining modern usability standards expected in B2B SaaS applications.
